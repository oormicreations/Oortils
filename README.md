# Oortils
A free addon for blender, has miscellaneous utilities 

Still under development.
Features implemented in ver 0.2.0:
* Opens blender in terminal (gnome). Only for Linux users.
* Assigns True Colors to objects, unlike the mostly same colors which we get by default.
* Reloads textures when edited outside of blender.
* Creates a turntable animation. Probably there are more addons that do this, but I wanted my own.
* Converts shader nodes to python script
* More coming soon.
